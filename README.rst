-- Doge on one-folder

one-folder is..
- a tool for the decentralised sharing of files in a scalable fashion
- a Bittorrent Sync clone intending to be compatible with Bittorrent Sync

Why?
----
Bittorrent Sync is great. Not open though. Needs to be open.

Bittorrent sync compatibility?
------------------------------
one-folder is not currently compatible with Bittorrent Sync.

Where possible, one-folder aims to be compatible with Bittorrent Sync. However because the specification for Bittorrent Sync is not public information, one-folder can't be compatible. I also don't have the resources to reverse engineer Bittorrent Sync sorry.
