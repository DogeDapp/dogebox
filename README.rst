Bittorrent Sync is great, but it's not open. Let's open it up!

Bittorrent sync compatibility
-----------------------------
Where possible, one-folder aims to be compatible with Bittorrent Sync. However because the specification for Bittorrent Sync is not public information, one-folder can't be compatible. I also don't have the resources to reverse engineer Bittorrent Sync sorry. This means: one-folder is not currently compatible with Bittorrent Sync.
