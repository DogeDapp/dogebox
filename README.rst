-- Doge on dogebox

dogebox is..
- a mechanism for running your own personal cloud storage 
- a tool for the decentralised sharing of files in a scalable fashion
- a Bittorrent Sync clone

Why?
----
Bittorrent Sync is great, but it's not open. Let's open it up!

Bittorrent sync compatibility
-----------------------------
Where possible, dogebox aims to be compatible with Bittorrent Sync (eg. API, interface)

However because the specification for Bittorrent Sync is not public information, dogebox can't be compatible with Bittorrent Sync shares. I also don't have the resources to reverse engineer Bittorrent Sync sorry.

This means: dogebox can't share with Bittorrent Sync shares, and probably won't ever be able to.
